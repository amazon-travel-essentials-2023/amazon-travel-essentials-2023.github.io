It's essential to remember that everyone's skin is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Before incorporating any new natural beauty products into your routine, it's advisable to do a patch test and consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional, especially if you have allergies or specific skin concerns. Additionally, always check the product's ingredient list to ensure it is truly natural and free from harmful additives or irritants.
